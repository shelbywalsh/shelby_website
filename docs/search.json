I have dedicated my life to improving and protecting the outdoors. In my career I hope to make a difference in the fight against climate change. Besides loving the outdoors, I also love DOGS, SPORTS, TRAVEL and FRENCH FRIES!\nBonnie the Batdog.

Nada Grocery is based out of Vancouver, BC and is in the business of changing how people interact with their food. My internship focused on Supplier relations and Supplier Initiative to find out where in the supply chain data was missing. We used this information to create a comprehensive carbon footprint for both 2019 and 2020 for Nada Grocery. Through our findings, we are setting up mitigation suggestions, data management plans and supplier outreach material.\nRetail Experience\nFor 2 years, I was fortunate enough to work for REI Co-op as a Sales Specialist. During this time I got to know the ins and outs of the outdoor retailer world. Though this experience I gained knowledge in sustainable clothing, gear fitting and overall outdoor outfitting. Working at REI lead me to graduate school to pursue a career in Corporate Environmental Management, with the hopes of working for a sustainable aparel company.\nIny Tent Challenge 2019Field work\nAs a member of the Washington Service Corps, I worked as a restoration aide for the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust. I spent the year performing in-stream surveys, trail work and restoring the natural habitat throughout the greater Seattle Area. Some of my fondest memories were running tree planting volunteer events and building new trails in the Middle Fork Wilderness Area.\nSnoqualmie River, WA: Washington Service Corps MemberForce of Nature Trail Restoration with Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust & REI Co-opSalmon Habitat Instream Restoration and Landscaping.
