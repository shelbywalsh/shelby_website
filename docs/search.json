I have dedicated my life to improving and protecting the outdoors. In my career I hope to make a difference in the fight against climate change. Besides loving the outdoors, I also am a huge sports fan.\nProfessional Interest:\nCarbon Accounting and Supply Chain Initiatives\nThrough my Master’s Group Project, I am able to work with a zero-waste online grocery retailer, Nada Grocery. Nada Grocery is based out of Vancouver, BC and is in the business of changing how people interact with their food. My internship focused on Supplier relations and Supplier Initiative to find out where in the supply chain data was missing. We used this information to create a comprehensive carbon footprint for both 2019 and 2020 for Nada Grocery. Through our findings, we are setting up mitigation suggestions, data management plans and supplier outreach material.\nRetail Experience\nFor 2 years, I was fortunate enough to work for REI Co-op as a Sales Specialist. During this time I got to know the ins and outs of the outdoor retailer world. Though this experience I gained knowledge in sustainable clothing, gear fitting and overall outdoor outfitting. Working at REI lead me to graduate school to pursue a career in Corporate Environmental Management, with the hopes of working for a sustainable aparel company.\nField work\nAs a member of the Washington Service Corps, I worked as a restoration aide for the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust. I spent the year performing in-stream surveys, trail work and restoring the natural habitat throughout the greater Seattle Area. Some of my fondest memories were running tree planting volunteer events and building new trails in the Middle Fork Wilderness Area.\nPortfolio Examples:\n\n\n\n",
