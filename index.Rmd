I am a 2nd year Graduate student at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I am specializing in Corporate Environmental Management with an immense passion for sustainable apparael and the outdoors. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, paddle boarding and playing with my 10 month old Belgian Malinois, Bonnie!
